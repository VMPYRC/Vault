> [!important] Content Creation, Self-Worth, #Productivity, #Art-Design
>
> - Are you burnout from being a creator? Or from being a marketer / promoter?
>     - Create for yourself, first and foremost.
>     - Do what makes you happy.
> - Numbers ≠ Quality.
>     - Don't judge your work by its engagement / attention / numbers.
>         - Engagement is not representative of artistic skill.
> - Productivity ≠ Worth.
>     - You are valuable regardless of what you accomplish.
>         - Do it for the experience, not the outcome.
>         - Don't put all your value in one project. Every experience counts.
> - Embrace imperfection.

> [!important] #Gaming x Completionism
>
> - Track, don't control.
>     - Track your progress, but don't obsess over it.
> - Take breaks to avoid burnout.
>     - Step away. Cool off. Refresh. Return. Reignite.

> [!important] #Life is unpredictable
>
> - It always happens to someone else, until it happens to you.
> - We all think we're immune… until we're not.
> - It's someone else's problem… until it's yours to face.
> - You never think it's going to happen to you… until it does.
> - We watch others go through it, ignorant that we might be next.

> [!important] #Library x Reading
>
> - No rush.
> - Read for the journey, not the finish line.
> - Enjoy the process, not just the end result.
> - Get lost in the words, not the book/page count.
> - Take time to truly experience the story.
> - Reading slowly means you get to spend more time in a world you love.
> - You don't need to finish every book you start.
> - Books don't expire—read when you're ready, not when you feel pressured. Return when you're refreshed.
> - Quality over quantity. One meaningful book is better than ten rushed ones. A book's impact matters more than how fast you read it.
